# MY MOVIE SHELF ANDROID APP
- I took this opportunity to use latest Android tools and technologies to build this massive fully functional Android App
- Currently submitted for Review to Google Play Console, awaiting approval and release to Google Play Store
- TOP 5 Movies CRUD functionality
- The project consists of a simple mobile app for movie fans to showcase ordered lists of their favorite movies. Users should be able to create multiple "Top 5" lists that will be displayed on their profile.

# Requirements
1. Simple sign-up/login/logout auth system (basic username + password will do).
2. Profile TOP5 lists CRUD functionality.
3. Ability to view another user's TOP5 Profile by providing their username.
4. Decisions can be made for caching and persistence needs.

# List Examples
"All-time Funniest Movies"
"Movies That Bring You To Tears"
"Movies With The Best Twist"
- Each list should be identified by a title and an emoji.

# Features
1. User Authentication
2. Simple sign-up/login/logout auth system (basic username + password with help of Room DB).
3. Profile TOP5 Lists CRUD Functionality
4. Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for movie lists.
5. View my multiple Top 5 Lists.
6. Ability to view another user's TOP5 Profile by providing their username.

# Development Technologies
1. Kotlin: Language used for development.
2. Jetpack Compose: For building declarative UI.
3. Room Database: For local storage of user credentials.
4. TMDB API: For fetching movie data.
5. Firebase Firestore: For storing user lists and movies.
6. Hilt: For Dependency Injection.
7. Kotlin Coroutines & Flow: For asynchronous programming.
8. MVVM Clean Architecture with Usecase Approach
